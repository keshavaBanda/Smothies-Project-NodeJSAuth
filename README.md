# Smothies-Project-NodeJSAuth
To Run the App use 
```sh 
    $npm install --force && npm start
```
This app is running under localhost:3000 I'm not sure if application is not running properly check mongodb is installed in your system because I connect the Node.js with JavaScript-based Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

After running the project to open the app use this [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
